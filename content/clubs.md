During my time at The University of Notre Dame I have been a part of the follwing clubs and organizations.

## Computer Science for Good

As a member of [CS for Good](/tags/cs-for-good/) since the Fall of 2023, I have been mostly involved in the [De Paul Coding Academy Project](/posts/coding-academy/). Through this organization I am able to utilize my skills as a Computer Scientist as a force for good in my local community.

## ColorStack

I have been a part of the [ColorStack](/tags/colorstack/) family since the fall of 2023, and joined the chapter at The University of Notre Dame in the spring of 2024. The organization consists of Hispanic and Black Computer Scientists which are underrepresented in the technology industry. The community shares and support each other, especially by peer reviewing resumes, sharing interview prep questions and career opportunities, etc.

## Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers

Joined in the Fall of 2023 and have been a member since.. SHPE provides Hispanic Engineers across all fields with career opportunities and take students on important conventions to help land internships and full-time job offers.

## Latino Honors Society

As a member of the LHS since the Fall of 2022, I have mantained a standard GPA and participated in events which are coordinated by the LHS council to support and relieve poor or suffering latino communities.

## Building Bridges

In the Fall of 2023 I was assigned upperclassmen mentors within the field of Computer Science which have guided me and helped me work on external projects as well as provided me with the resources to exceed in such a challenging field.

## Puerto Rican Student Association at Notre Dame

Being from Puerto Rico, I joined PRSAND in the Fall of 2022, where this organizaiton has organized cultural events and fundraisers for causes related to Puerto Rican issues, as well as get togethers to eat cultural food and have a good time away from home.
