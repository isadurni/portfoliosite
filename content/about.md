At 20 years old, I stand at the exciting intersection of youth and technology, where the rapid pace of digital advancement resonates with my own eagerness to learn, grow, and innovate.

My academic journey is defined by a relentless pursuit of knowledge, where challenging coursework and hands-on projects have honed my skills in programming. Beyond the classroom, I am involved in extracurricular activities that enrich my understanding of technology's role in society and its potential for positive change. From developing my own projects to engaging in community service projects, I strive to apply my technical skills in ways that benefit others and address real-world problems.

Through my portfolio, I aim to showcase not just the projects and achievements that mark my academic and personal growth, but also the passion and determination that drive me forward. As I continue my journey at Notre Dame, I am excited to explore new opportunities, embrace challenges, and contribute to the ever-evolving field of computer science.
